  - Authentication flow (JWT + refresh token + OAuth integration)
  - File storage strategy (S3 + CloudFront CDN)
  - API versioning strategy (/api/v1)
  
- **Low-Level Design (LLD)**
  - Component hierarchy and data flow (unidirectional data flow with Context API)
  - State management architecture (Context + useReducer for complex forms)
  - API request/response structure (standardized error codes, pagination)
  - Database indexing strategy (compound indexes for query optimization)
  - Caching strategy (Redis for sessions, browser cache for assets)

#### üß† Core Business Logic

  <!-- - ATS (Applicant Tracking System) optimization scoring -->
  - Multi-format export (PDF, DOCX, JSON) with formatting preservation
  
- **Cover Letter Intelligence**
  - Job description parsing and keyword extraction (custom NLP logic)
  - Tone adjustment system (professional, friendly, formal)
  <!-- - Personalization engine based on user profile -->
  
- **AI Integration Layer**
  - OpenAI API wrapper with retry logic and fallback handling
  - Prompt engineering for cover letter generation

#### üîê Authentication & Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC) system (Free, Pro, Enterprise tiers)
- OAuth 2.0 integration (Google, LinkedIn)
- Password reset flow with secure token generation
- Session management with Redis
- Account verification email workflow

#### ‚ö° Performance Optimization
- **Frontend**
  - Code splitting and lazy loading strategy
  - Image optimization pipeline (WebP conversion, lazy loading)

  <!-- - Service Worker for offline capability -->
  
- **Backend**
  - Database query optimization (N+1 query elimination)
  - Redis caching layer implementation
  <!-- - API response compression (gzip/brotli) -->
  <!-- - Connection pooling and reuse -->

## üìù Detailed Prompt Examples

### Example 1: Resume Template Component
```
‚ùå What I DIDN'T do: "Build me a complete resume builder app"

‚úÖ What I DID: "Create a React component skeleton for a resume 
   section with title, description, and date range fields"

AI Output: Basic component structure with props ‚úì
```

### Example 2: API Error Handling
```
‚ùå What I DIDN'T do: "Write all my API error handling"

‚úÖ What I DID: "Create a basic Express error middleware function"

AI Output: Simple try-catch wrapper ‚úì

My Implementation:
- Built centralized error handling system with custom error classes
- Implemented error code standardization (ERR_AUTH_001, etc.)
- Added context-aware error messages for users
- Created error logging pipeline (file + Sentry + Slack alerts)
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
```

## üß† My Problem-Solving Approach

### Complex Challenges I Solved Independently:

#### 1. **PDF Generation Performance Issue**
**Problem:** PDF generation was taking 8-10 seconds for complex resumes  
**AI Couldn't Help With:** Understanding the bottleneck in my specific architecture  
**My Solution:**
- Profiled the rendering pipeline (identified HTML-to-PDF conversion bottleneck)
- Implemented server-side rendering with Puppeteer pool
- Added pre-rendering for common templates
- Reduced generation time to 1.5-2 seconds (80% improvement)
- Implemented job queue for async generation on free tier

#### 2. **Real-time Collaboration Feature**
**Problem:** Multiple users editing same resume causing conflicts  
**AI Couldn't Help With:** Designing conflict resolution strategy for my data model  
**My Solution:**
- Implemented Operational Transformation (OT) algorithm
- Built WebSocket connection manager with auto-reconnection
- Created conflict resolution UI for manual merge
- Added cursor position broadcasting
- Implemented optimistic UI updates with rollback capability

#### 3. **Scalability for Viral Growth**
**Problem:** App went from 100 to 10,000 users in 2 days  
**AI Couldn't Help With:** Architecting for sudden scale  
**My Solution:**
- Implemented horizontal scaling with load balancer
- Moved session storage to Redis cluster
- Added CDN for static assets (CloudFront)
- Implemented database read replicas
- Created background job queue for heavy operations
- Added circuit breaker pattern for external API calls
- Result: Handled 50,000 concurrent users with 99.9% uptime

## üìà My Philosophy on AI in Development

AI is like a skilled assistant working under my direction:
    ‚îú‚îÄ Great at: Repetitive tasks, boilerplate, standard patterns
    ‚îú‚îÄ Not great at: Complex logic, architecture decisions, optimization
    ‚îî‚îÄ My role: Lead developer who directs, reviews, and makes all final decisions

I use AI to:
‚úÖ Accelerate development, not replace thinking
‚úÖ Handle boilerplate so I can focus on hard problems
‚úÖ Generate options for me to evaluate and improve
‚úÖ Speed up routine tasks while I architect the solution

I DON'T use AI for:
‚ùå System design and architecture decisions
‚ùå Business logic implementation
‚ùå Security-critical code without thorough review
‚ùå Performance-critical algorithms
‚ùå Learning shortcuts (I understand everything I ship)

My Approach:
  ‚îú‚îÄ I define the problem and architecture
  ‚îú‚îÄ AI helps with implementation scaffolding
  ‚îú‚îÄ I review, refine, and optimize every line
  ‚îî‚îÄ Full ownership and understanding of the codebase
